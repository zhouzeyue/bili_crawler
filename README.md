The file pa-cursor & test01-r1 are available to scrap video titles, uploaders, and BVs from a Bilibili favorites list.

BTW, the file convert is used to delete other columns and keep the 'title' column.

Then you can give this file to AI (I'm using notebooklm) and have it help you analyze the types of videos in your favorites.
